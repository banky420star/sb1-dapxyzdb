## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### 1. API Key Permissions (Critical)
```
Error: Bybit API Error: API key is invalid. (Code: 10003)
```
**Problem**: The API key doesn't have sufficient permissions for spread trading operations.

**Solution**: 
1. Log into your Bybit account
2. Go to API Management
3. Check the API key permissions
4. Ensure the following permissions are enabled:
   - **Read** permissions for account data
   - **Trade** permissions for spread trading
   - **Spot & Derivatives Trading** permissions

### 2. Spread Trading Endpoints (Critical)
```
Error: HTTP 404: Not Found
```
**Problem**: Spread trading endpoints are returning 404 errors.

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Testnet Limitations**: Spread trading might not be fully available on testnet
2. **Account Setup**: Spread trading might not be enabled for your account
3. **Endpoint Path**: The API endpoint path might be different

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Account Settings**:
   - Log into Bybit testnet
   - Navigate to Spread Trading section
   - Ensure spread trading is enabled for your account

2. **Try Mainnet**:
   - Create a mainnet API key with proper permissions
   - Test with mainnet credentials (use small amounts)

3. **Verify Endpoints**:
   - Check if spread trading is available in your region
   - Contact Bybit support for endpoint verification

   ```javascript
   // Update config to mainnet
   const config = {
     apiKey: 'your_mainnet_api_key',
     secret: 'your_mainnet_secret',
     testnet: false  // Use mainnet
   }
   ```
