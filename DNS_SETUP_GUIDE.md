# DNS Configuration Guide for MetaTrader Pro

## 🌐 Current Domain Status

- ✅ **Main Domain**: `methtrader.xyz` - WORKING
- ❌ **Subdomain**: `trader.methtrader.xyz` - NOT RESOLVING (REMOVED)

## 🔧 Consolidated Domain Strategy

Based on [DNS best practices](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/dns-on-windows/0596005628/ch10s04s01.html), we've consolidated everything under the main domain to avoid complexity and CORS issues.

### ✅ Current Configuration

All services are now configured under `methtrader.xyz`:

```
methtrader.xyz (MAIN DOMAIN)
├── / (Landing Page - Gateway)
├── /dashboard (Trading Dashboard)
├── /trading (Live Trading Interface)
├── /models (AI Training Hub)
├── /risk (Risk Management)
├── /analytics (Performance Analytics)
├── /settings (System Configuration)
└── /futuristic (Futuristic Landing)
```

### 🔧 Environment Variables Updated

```bash
# Domain Configuration - Consolidated to main domain
DOMAIN=methtrader.xyz
VITE_API_URL=https://methtrader.xyz
VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://methtrader.xyz/ws
```

## 🚀 Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Simplified DNS Management**: No subdomain complexity
2. **Eliminated CORS Issues**: All requests go to same domain
3. **Better SSL Management**: Single certificate covers everything
4. **Improved Performance**: No DNS lookups for subdomains
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Single domain to manage

## 📋 Landing Page Features

The main landing page (`/`) now serves as a functional gateway with:

- **Quick Access Buttons**: Direct navigation to all platform sections
- **Login Modal**: Authentication interface
- **Feature Showcase**: Interactive cards linking to key features
- **System Status**: Real-time connection indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
